# Contributing to Waltz
Thanks for your interest in the project! Here is some basic information about how to contribute.
 
# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
All contributions to [Waltz Open Source](http://www.waltz-technology.com/) projects must be made under a [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/khartec/waltz/blob/master/ccla.pdf) that authorizes the project to distribute your code under the LGPL v3 License.

# Contributing Issues
 
## Raising an Issue
* Please raise issues either directly in Github or via the project mailing list (waltz-dev@googlegroups.com)
* Please also tag the new issue with either "Bug" or "Enhancement".
 
# Contributing Pull Requests (Code & Docs)
To make review of PRs easier, please:
 
 * For major enhancements before working on any PR, please review the proposal with the project group via mailing list <waltz-dev@googlegroups.com> or via the Github issue to align it with roadmap.
 * Please make sure your PRs will merge cleanly - PRs that don't are unlikely to be accepted.
 * For code contributions, follow the general structure of the existing code.
 * For documentation contributions, follow the general structure, language, and tone of the existing docs.
 * Keep PRs small and cohesive - if you have multiple contributions, please submit them as independent PRs.
 * Minimize non-functional changes (e.g. whitespace shenanigans).
 * Ensure all new files include a header comment block containing the [license and your copyright information](https://github.com/khartec/waltz/blob/master/NOTICE.md).
