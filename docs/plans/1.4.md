# Waltz 1.4 and beyond


## Executive Summary

The next release of Waltz (1.4 est. mid April 2017) will focus on the following 
main topics:
- Measurable Viewpoints
- Change Initiative Viewpoints
- Data types on physical flows

Before outlining the plan in more detail let us recap what was delivered in the 1.3 
release.



## Recap of 1.3

The release of 1.3 (on 20th Apr 2017) introduced __3 new__ features:

- Physical Specification management: metadata describing contents of specs
- Flow Diagrams (new)
- Surveys: simple survey builder and enhanced integration

We also __deferred__ 2 planned features 

- Perspective visualisation: rolling into _Measurable Viewpoints_
- Inter-measurable relationships: rolling into _Measurable Viewpoints_



## Main Features

- Measurable enhancements
- Change Initiative enhancements
- Data types on physical specifications


### Measurable Enhancements

Currently the pages devoted to measurables are very app-centric.  This change 
will allow for a richer collection of data about the measurable instance.  

Relevant enabling-enhancements:

- Perspective Visualisation
- Inter-measurable relationships
- People Associations
- Entity Notes


### Change Initiative Enhancements

(Similar to the _Measurable enhancements_ feature described above).  
 
Relevant enabling-enhancements:

- People Associations
- Entity Notes


### Data types on physical specifications
  
We currently allow data types to be associated to logical flows but not physical 
specification. 
This modification will extend the physical spec information to include data types. 
Data types between logical and physical flows will be synchronised to ensure they 
remain consistent.



## Enabling Enhancements

### Perspective visualisation

We need to be able to visualize relevant perspectives from within a measurable
view.   This could be as simple as drawing (potentially v. large) grid.

#### Inter-measurable relationships

Implicit relationships can be seen via the related measurables section - this 
simply looks for measurables used by applications which also utilise the selected
measurable.  As such it is only a rough guide.  

Measurables should also support explicit links to other measurables to allow for 
quick navigation/exploration/filtering of related concepts. These relationships 
may be thought of similarly to traits - something that binds disparate elements. 
For example we may wish to relate Investment Banking as a business line to the 
product, processes or other measurables that it supports.

#### People Associations 

Measurables may be optionally related to key individuals within the organization.  
However there is rarely an authoritative source for these relationships to 
automatically import,  therefore we will allow for user entered associations to 
be allowed.  This ability will require a specific permission and also be enabled 
on a measurable category basis.

#### Entity Notes

Currently main entities tend to only have a single description field.  This 
limitation will be addressed by allowing for multiple _named notes_ to be 
attached to an entity.  The names of the notes will not be end-user editable
but will be configurable via administrative actions.  The decision to restrict
the names associated with notes was made to ensure the data can be re-used as 
widely as possible.
